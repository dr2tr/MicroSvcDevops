This is to quickly setup a workspace of Kafka with Docker (RH7.5 in VBox)

Steps:
1. setup RH7.5 in Vbox and get it ready for use (yum source, docker source to CN; necessary installation of docker/docker-compose; network setup for VM)
2. Define proper docker-compose.yml (the one in env is good. the one in env0 still needs to be fixed.)
3. use "docker-compose up -d" to start. use "docker ps" to check status
4. use "docker-compose scale kafka=3" to increase kafka instances. (The scale command is deprecated. Use the up command with the --scale flag instead.)
5. visit http://192.168.50.199:32836 to manage Kafka with kafka manager (ip and port may be different.)

Update added 4/16/2019 for step #5 above.
the port number of Kafka manager could be found by "docker-compose ps"
the port should be open via "iptables -A INPUT -ptcp --dport  $PORTNUM -j ACCEPT" (use "netstat -anp | grep $PORTNUM" to see whehter port is open). REMEMBER to use "service firewalld stop/start" to reload firewall changes.
